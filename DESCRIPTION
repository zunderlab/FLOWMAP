Description: An Implementation of FLOW-MAP Algorithm in R. It takes user-specified inputs
    for settings of a FLOW-MAP analysis and generates a FLOW-MAP graph from provided FCS files
    or dataframes. Results include graphml files for the FLOW-MAP graph as well as a graph resolved
    by a force-directed layout, as well as auto-generated PDFs for the resolved graph colored by
    each node parameter. A summary text file is autogenerated to summarize the settings of a
    particular run. A Shiny GUI is also available to establish FLOW-MAP settings and begin a FLOW-MAP
    analysis. Please see the accompanying README.md file and our GitHub repo for more detailed
    instructions and examples.
