Description: An Implementation of FLOW-MAP Algorithm in R. It takes user-specified
    inputs for settings of a FLOW-MAP analysis and generates a FLOW-MAP graph from provided
    FCS files. Results include graphml files for the original graph as well as a graph
    resolved by a force-directed layout, as well as auto-generated PDFs for the resolved
    graph colored by each node parameter. A summary text file is autogenerated to
    summarize the settings of a particular run. A Shiny GUI is also available to enter
    FLOW-MAP settings and begin a FLOW-MAP analysis. Please see the accompanying README.md
    file for instructions and examples.
